Hey there! Nice to meet you.

This is my (possibly self-absorbed) attempt to start us on the right foot. Much like myself, this document is always in beta. I proudly found this idea from a [co-worker](https://critter.blog/working-with-me/), who adapted it from [elsewhere on the internet](https://hackernoon.com/12-manager-readmes-from-silicon-valleys-top-tech-companies-26588a660afe). If you have a document like this _please, please, please_ share it with me. If not, you should definitely [consider writing one](/posts/readmes-be-good/).

## Communication
If you need to reach out to me, please ping me on chat. Please, use the most appropriate public channel based on the topic of discussion. I am not a fan of [private conversations](http://blog.flowdock.com/2014/04/30/beware-of-private-conversations/) if it doesn't _need_ to be private.

If it's a longer discussion, let's jump on a video call. I'm happy to read through emails, however, I find that a synchronous discussion where we are both fully present leads to the best results in these matters.

Please **avoid** booking meetings with me that _do not_ include agendas. I'm always happy to share time on my calendar for any reason, I just ask that you include that reason within the meeting invite so that I can best prepare for the conversation.

## Schedule
I relish being a remote employee, and the flexibility to create the best life for myself, and my family that a remote environment provides. Typically, speaking I work 9am - 5pm Central Time. It is not unusual that I will take calls outside of these hours _when necessary_; just as it is not unusual that I might need to schedule other activities during these hours and time shift as necessary. I do not answer emails or chat outside of my working hours.

Please let me know your typical working hours. If I ever reach out to you outside of your working hours (sometimes I'm just too excited to contain myself), _do not_ respond until you have returned to work.

## Feedback
I am constantly looking for feedback, so please trust me when I say you won't offend me. Whatever your feedback may be please just keep it honest and timely. While I appreciate constructive criticism I also like to process my reaction, note my areas of improvement and catalog my progress, therefore I prefer to receive feedback in a written manner.

Likewise, you can expect me to give candid and timely feedback to you. Please, let me know how you prefer to receive feedback.
