## My Mom the Superhero

I grew up with a single-mom. This means that my mom wasn't always there for PTA meetings or to watch soccer practice, but she showed me every day what it took to manage a career and a family and a household. I watched her struggle to juggle all of the things in her life and I felt the pain when I fell short on _my_ obligations to the family. The experience left me feeling empowered that as a woman, I don't have to decide between having a fulfilling career and a happy family. It also taught me to expect that I can do everything on my own without help from anyone. 

The result being a daughter who is probably a little more independent than her mother would like. Also, a human with high expectations for herself and her life. 

In retrospect, I now see all of the support that she used. We had babysitters and day care while she was at work. The family was all expected to take on some household duties. And her staff backed her up at work.

Watching my mom do it all taught me that I could be my own superhero. That there was nothing out of my reach. So I reached for everything: I want to be a good wife/daughter/friend, have a clean house, keep up on fashion trends, make time to stay fit and healthy _and_ have a growing career. And (and this is the big one) I also wanted time for myself, for fun and learning and finding new interests and everything else.

## Being Human is Hard

As an adult I realize how much work that is on a single human being. When I start out my day wearing all of these roles -- wife, engineer, friend, daughter, housekeeper, runner, etc -- I would get to the end of day and realize I never had any time to just be myself. Every piece of my day was given to someone or something else, because I learned that a good woman put everyone else's need before their own.

I've often felt myself failing to do it all and so I'm always curious when I see other people out there in the wild that seem to have it all together. I often ask my mentors and friends, especially other women, how they manage to do it all. 

One of my best friends [Lesley Guthrie](https://lesleyguthrie.com/) has been telling me for years that she doesn't clean her house. And the first time she told me that it was like a light went off in my head. How can you just _not_ do that? How do you rationalize the expense? Well it's different for you, you have kids they need that. "It saved my marriage" she finally told me, reflecting on how the division of labor and expectations meant that she was taking on more work than her spouse.

## I can't do this all on my own

Like many, this year has not been an easy one for me. My father passed away from complications due to COVID-19 this spring and at the same time my mother was going through chemotherapy for the second time while I was wrapping up leading a enterprise website engagement and soon after decided to transition careers. It's been a year to say the least. I've been stretched to my ultimate limits and with all of the additional demands on my time and energy I found myself trying to take care of all of my people, attempting to support my career and my customers while still trying to balance day-to-day obligations. But, eventually, I had to face the facts that I couldn't do it all.

So this year I've changed my strategy. I can _have_ it all without _doing_ it all. In fact, what I'm coming to understand is that _doing_ it all doesn't serve myself or my family. I want to spend the days that I have doing the things that I'm actually good at or that only I can do. The things that are most valuable to me.

## Get Help

> It takes a village to raise a child

This idiom has been repeated throughout the years. But perhaps the "to raise a child" part is the part we should let go of. As a society, we understand that new parents need support and are undergoing a new challenge as they try to help their child become a person. Maybe we need to give ourselves the same compassion and understanding regardless of what stage of life we're at.

From here on out I'm advocating that **it takes a village to be a human**.

This year I've decided to let go of the things that don't spark joy for me. I hired cleaning services so that I don't have to be taking on the responsibility and invisible labor of knowing when are the showers due to be cleaned and who last scrubbed the toilet. I hired a financial planner to help me plan for my future and I'm re-investing time in counseling to make sure that I'm taking care of myself in the midst of taking care of all of the other people I care about.

***

I treasure the memories of growing up and thinking that my mom was a superhero. I love that I grew up with an example of womanhood that was being a person with strong and driven career and someone who cared deeply about her people and managed to juggle all of the other things in life. But, I'm choosing to re-evaluate my taming. I've found that some of those roles don't fit me.

This all crystalized for me when I was listening to [Bridget Perry](https://www.contentful.com/blog/author/bridget-perry/), CMO at Contentful, discuss how she managed her career and family after being diagnosed with cancer.

> When I saw all the help I was getting, I started to learn how much I was doing all by myself. I learned that I need to get help so that I can focus on the things that really matter to me.

## I'm no superman

As flattering as the idea of being someone's superhero is for me, that cape doesn't really fit. In fact, it kind of strangles me. So instead of doing it _everything_ I'm going to focus on the fact that I can do _anything_. I'm prioritizing the things that matter most, spark the most joy and things only I can do (like be my husband's wife). I'm getting help on the rest.
