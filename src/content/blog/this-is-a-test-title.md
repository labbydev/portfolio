We cannot control the environment.

\* This is true. But we also contribute to it. Like we can't control that there is a tornado happening, but humans have contributed to climate change that cause tornados. And similarly we can't control the environment in which we work, but the company culture contributes, the team dynamics contribute. How are you contributing?
