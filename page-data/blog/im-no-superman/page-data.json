Every piece of my day was given to someone or something else.</p>\n<p>I've often felt myself failing to do it all and so I'm always curious when I see other people out there in the wild that seem to have it all together. I often ask my mentors and friends, especially other women, how they manage to do it all.</p>\n<h2>I can't do this all on my own</h2>\n<p>Earlier this year, I buried my father and helped care for my sick mother. During the same time at work I was working to launch a website and wrap up a project. After which, I ended up switching jobs. I've been stretched to my ultimate limits and with all of the additional demands on my time. I had to face the facts: I couldn't do it all.</p>\n<p>So this year I've changed my strategy. I can <em>have</em> it all without <em>doing</em> it all. In fact, what I'm coming to understand is that <em>doing</em> it all doesn't serve myself or my family. I want to spend the days that I have doing the things that I'm actually good at or that only I can do. The things that are most valuable to me.</p>\n<h2>Get Help</h2>\n<p>This year I've decided to let go of the things that don't spark joy for me. I order out more than I'd like to admit. I hired cleaning services and a financial planner. I'm re-investing time in counseling to make sure that I'm taking care of myself in the midst of taking care of all of the other people I care about.</p>\n<p>This all crystalized for me when I was listening to <a href=\"https://www.contentful.com/blog/author/bridget-perry/\">Bridget Perry</a>, CMO at Contentful, discuss how she managed her career and family after being diagnosed with cancer.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When I saw all the help I was getting, I started to learn how much I was doing all by myself. I learned that I need to get help so that I can focus on the things that really matter to me.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>I'm no superman</h2>\n<p>Instead of doing it <em>everything</em> I'm going to focus on the fact that I can do <em>anything</em>. I'm prioritizing the things that matter most, spark the most joy and things only I can do. I'm getting help on the rest.</p>","timeToRead":2,"frontmatter":{"path":"/blog/im-no-superman","title":"I'm no superman","date":"Tuesday | September 14, 2021"}}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":["2536268595","3649515864"]}
