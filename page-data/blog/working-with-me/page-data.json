Nice to meet you.</p>\n<p>This is my (possibly self-absorbed) attempt to start us on the right foot. Much like myself, this document is always in beta. I proudly found this idea from a <a href=\"https://critter.blog/working-with-me/\">co-worker</a>, who adapted it from <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/12-manager-readmes-from-silicon-valleys-top-tech-companies-26588a660afe\">elsewhere on the internet</a>. If you have a document like this <em>please, please, please</em> share it with me. If not, you should definitely <a href=\"/blog/why-you-need-a-readme\">consider writing one</a>.</p>\n<h2>Communication</h2>\n<p>If you need to reach out to me, please ping me on chat. Please, use the most appropriate public channel based on the topic of discussion. I am not a fan of <a href=\"http://blog.flowdock.com/2014/04/30/beware-of-private-conversations/\">private conversations</a> if it doesn't <em>need</em> to be private.</p>\n<p>If it's a longer discussion, let's jump on a video call. I'm happy to read through emails, however, I find that a synchronous discussion where we are both fully present leads to the best results in these matters.</p>\n<p>Please <strong>avoid</strong> booking meetings with me that <em>do not</em> include agendas. I'm always happy to share time on my calendar for any reason, I just ask that you include that reason within the meeting invite so that I can best prepare for the conversation.</p>\n<h2>Schedule</h2>\n<p>I relish being a remote employee, and the flexibility to create the best life for myself, and my family that a remote environment provides. Typically, speaking I work 9am - 5pm Central Time. It is not unusual that I will take calls outside of these hours <em>when necessary</em>; just as it is not unusual that I might need to schedule other activities during these hours and time shift as necessary. I do not answer emails or chat outside of my working hours.</p>\n<p>Please let me know your typical working hours. If I ever reach out to you outside of your working hours (sometimes I'm just too excited to contain myself), <em>do not</em> respond until you have returned to work.</p>\n<h2>Feedback</h2>\n<p>I am constantly looking for feedback, so please trust me when I say you won't offend me. Whatever your feedback may be please just keep it honest and timely. While I appreciate constructive criticism I also like to process my reaction, note my areas of improvement and catalog my progress, therefore I prefer to receive feedback in a written manner.</p>\n<p>Likewise, you can expect me to give candid and timely feedback to you. Please, let me know how you prefer to receive feedback.</p>","timeToRead":2,"frontmatter":{"path":"/blog/working-with-me/","title":"Working with Me","date":"Wednesday | July 29, 2020"}}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":["2536268595","3649515864"]}
